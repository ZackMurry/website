      Hi! I'm Zack, a second-year undergraduate student in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Missouri. I
      work as a student research assistant in the Virtualization, Multimedia, and Networking (VIMAN) lab, where I study
      computer networking, drone navigation, and edge computing.
    </p>
    <p className='text-zinc-600'>
      This past summer (2024), I did an internship at the University of Chicago researching distributed computing using
      Raspberry Pis. Outside of research, I also enjoy full-stack web development, compilers, and robots!
